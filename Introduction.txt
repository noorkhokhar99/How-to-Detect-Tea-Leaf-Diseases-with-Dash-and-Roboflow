Deploying a deep learning model for a tea plantation involves several steps. First, collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of tea plant images, including those showing healthy and unhealthy conditions, pests, and diseases. Next, train the model on a powerful computing platform, evaluating its performance to ensure accuracy. Once trained, deploy the model to either a cloud or on-premises server and integrate it with the plantation management system. Finally, continuously monitor the model performance and update it with new data as needed to maintain accuracy.

The following diagram shows a high-level overview of the deep learning model's workflow in a tea plantation farm:
